    <h1>Animal</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Animals are ,<a href="#nowwhere">multicellular</a> eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With
        few exceptions, animals
        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an
        ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic
        development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are
        insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from
        8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their
        environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.

        Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The
        Bilateria include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and
        molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the
        vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late
        Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during
        the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living
        animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years
        ago.

        Historically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first
        hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
        expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa
        (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern
        times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics,
        which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and
        multicellular.[9][10] Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients,[11] animals are
        heterotrophic,[10][12] feeding on organic material and digesting it internally.[13] With very few exceptions,
        (example; Henneguya zschokkei[14]) animals respire aerobically.[15] All animals are motile[16] (able to
        spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges,
        corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is
        unique to animals, allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.[17]

    <h3>Structure</h3>
    <p>
        All animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and
        elastic glycoproteins.[18] During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible
        framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures
        possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules.[19] In contrast, the
        cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and
        so develop by progressive growth.[20] Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions,
        gap junctions, and desmosomes.[21]
